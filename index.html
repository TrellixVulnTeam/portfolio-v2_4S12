                    I became a software engineer, because I wanted to combine my skills and passions into a career. An audio engineer and drummer by day, and a bartender by night, I was searching for work that would bolster my creative tendencies and my penchant for arranging and organizing. When my journey led me to software development a lightbulb went off above my head. I realized that by writing code I was still able to work with a team to create something bigger than all of us. Something that not only clients wanted and needed, but something that helped them achieve their own goals and visions, and at the end of the day that makes me a happy camper.
